Environment Context: We use Bun for package management; please tailor command suggestions and installation examples for Bun.

Modification Scope: Modify only the parts of the code directly related to the request.

Preservation: Preserve all formatting and original names, and retain comments, annotations, and documentation verbatim unless explicitly requested otherwise.

Error Handling: After making modifications, check for TypeScript errors by running `bun run check-errors` and fix any issues before finalizing the code output. Additional error-checking steps are not required.

Output Format: If modifications are applied, output the complete code (not just a diff) so I can easily copy and paste it.

TODO Management: When a user requests a long-running or complex task:
1. Create a TODO list to track the work that needs to be done
2. If a TODO list already exists, continue working on those tasks instead of creating a new one
3. Update the TODO list as tasks are completed
4. Remove completed TODO items once they are successfully finished
