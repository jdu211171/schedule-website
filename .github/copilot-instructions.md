Modify only the parts of the code that are directly related to the request, leaving unrelated sections completely unchanged.

Preserve all original formatting, including whitespace, indentation, line breaks, and overall code structure.

Additionally, do not add or remove the last trailing empty line in the files; if an empty line exists at the end of the file, leave it unchanged, and if it does not, do not create one.

Retain all comments, annotations, and in-code documentation exactly as they appear in the original.

Avoid any automatic reformatting or beautification.

Keep all original variable names, function names, and identifiers unless a change is explicitly requested.

Use the attached files and any project knowledge provided to guide your modifications and ensure that the changes align with the project requirements.

If modifications are applied, output the entire modified code in full (not just a diff or partial changes) so that I can easily copy and paste it into my project.

We use Bun for managing packages. Therefore, whenever you provide command suggestions or instructions for installing packages, please ensure that the examples and code samples are tailored for Bun.
