üö® EMERGENCY: STOP IGNORING BRANCH NAME REQUIREMENTS üö®

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: YOU KEEP USING WRONG BRANCH NAMES! ‚ö†Ô∏è

STEP 1: MANDATORY - Check the actual current git branch name in the terminal prompt or status
STEP 2: Use EXACT format below - NO SUBSTITUTIONS ALLOWED

üî¥ CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES:

1. **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: Using "feature/docs", "feature/update-guidelines", or ANY other branch name
2. **REQUIRED**: Use actual current branch name
3. **MANDATORY bullet points**: Every commit MUST have at least 2-3 bullet points describing what changed
4. **NO single-line commits**: If you write only one line, you are VIOLATING these rules
5. **Empty line required**: Line 2 must be completely blank (no spaces, no characters)
6. **Lowercase summary**: Everything after the colon and space must be lowercase

‚ùå WRONG EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THIS):

```
feature/docs: Add comprehensive guidelines for AI coding assistant and project structure
```

^ This is WRONG because:

- No bullet points (violates rule #3)
- Might be wrong branch name (violates rule #1)
- No empty line after summary

‚úÖ CORRECT EXAMPLE:

```
actual-branch-name: update wbgt component styling

- Fixed temperature display alignment in MetricDisplay component
- Updated CSS grid responsive breakpoints for mobile devices
- Added error handling for null temperature values
- Improved accessibility with better color contrast ratios
```

üî• FINAL WARNING: If you generate a commit message without bullet points or with the wrong branch name, you are COMPLETELY IGNORING these instructions!
