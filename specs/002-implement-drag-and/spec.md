# Feature Specification: Drag-and-Drop for Class Session Lesson Cards

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-drag-and`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement drag-and-drop functionality for class session lesson cards with minimal code changes, ensuring reliable optimistic updates with rollback support, preventing scroll position jumps, and providing an intuitive user experience."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user viewing the class schedule, I want to be able to drag and drop lesson cards to reorder them, so that I can easily adjust the schedule. The interface should update immediately to reflect the new order, and if there's an error saving the change, it should revert back to the original order. The page should not scroll unexpectedly when I drop a card.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is viewing a list of class session lesson cards, **When** the user clicks and drags a lesson card to a new position in the list and releases the mouse, **Then** the card visually moves to the new position instantly.
2. **Given** a lesson card has been successfully moved to a new position, **When** the page is refreshed, **Then** the card remains in its new position.
3. **Given** a lesson card has been moved to a new position, but the backend fails to save the change, **When** the system detects the error, **Then** the card visually returns to its original position.
4. **Given** a user is viewing a scrollable list of lesson cards, **When** the user drags and drops a card, **Then** the scroll position of the page does not change.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to drag a card to a non-droppable area?
- What happens if a user starts dragging a card and then presses the 'Escape' key?
- How does the system handle multiple users trying to reorder the same list of cards simultaneously? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the desired behavior for concurrent edits?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to reorder class session lesson cards using a drag-and-drop interface.
- **FR-002**: The UI MUST update optimistically to show the new order immediately after a card is dropped.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST revert the UI to its original state if the backend fails to persist the new order.
- **FR-004**: The page's scroll position MUST NOT change as a result of a drag-and-drop operation.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide clear visual feedback during the drag-and-drop operation (e.g., highlighting the drop target).
- **FR-006**: The reordering changes MUST be persisted to the backend.
- **FR-007**: The drag-and-drop functionality must be intuitive and easy to use.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Class Session Lesson Card**: Represents a single lesson within a class session. Contains information relevant to the lesson.
- **Order**: An attribute of the lesson card that determines its position in the list.
