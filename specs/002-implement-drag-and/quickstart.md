# Quickstart: Testing Drag-and-Drop

1.  Navigate to a page displaying class session lesson cards.
2.  Drag and drop a lesson card to a new position.
3.  Verify the card stays in the new position after a page refresh.
4.  (To test rollback) Use browser developer tools to simulate a network error for the reorder API call. Drag and drop a card. Verify it returns to its original position.
