# Feature Specification: Instant day calendar update after session creation

**Feature Branch**: `013-when-i-create`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "When I create a regular class session from the day calendar or class series, it doesn‚Äôt automatically appear in the day calendar and I have to refresh the page to see it. Can we fix this so the new session shows up immediately without refreshing?"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: Should new session updates propagate in real time beyond the tab where creation happened? ‚Üí A: All tabs for the same user update automatically.
- Q: Which time zone should the day calendar use to place and display newly created sessions? ‚Üí A: Fixed global time zone ‚Äî Asia/Tokyo (per existing project convention).
- Q: When a newly created session is hidden by active filters, what feedback should the user receive? ‚Üí A: Show generic success toast; no filter-specific message.
- Q: For class series, does creating a session happen on the same page (popup) or a different page? ‚Üí A: Same page popup (modal/drawer), aligned with existing project patterns.
- Q: After creating a session, should the calendar auto-scroll to the new session? ‚Üí A: Do not auto-scroll; keep current scroll position.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a scheduler (or teacher/administrator), when I create a regular class session from the day calendar or from a class series context, the newly created session should appear immediately in the day calendar without requiring a manual page refresh, so I can confirm scheduling changes in real time and proceed with further actions confidently.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given the day calendar is open on date D with no filters that would hide the new session, When I create a new session on date D from the day calendar flow, Then the session tile appears in the correct time slot on the day calendar within 1 second, without a full page reload.
2. Given the day calendar is open on date D and a session is created for date D from a class series popup on the same page, When I complete the creation, Then the new session appears in the day calendar on date D within 1 second, without a full page reload.
3. Given the day calendar is open on date D with active filters that exclude the new session (e.g., filtered to Teacher A but the session is for Teacher B), When I create the session, Then the session does not appear in the current view and a generic success toast is shown; no filter-specific message or auto filter changes occur.
4. Given the day calendar is open on date D, When I create a session on a different date D2, Then the current day calendar for D does not change and I receive confirmation of creation; if I navigate to D2, the new session is present. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the UI offer a quick jump to the created date?]
5. Given I create a session and the creation fails (e.g., validation or server error), When the error occurs, Then no new session appears in the calendar and I see a clear error message; any temporary UI indicator should be cleared.
6. Given the same user has the day calendar open in another tab on date D, When a new session is created for date D in one tab, Then the other tab displays the new session within 1 second without a full page reload.

### Edge Cases

- Overlapping sessions: If the new session overlaps with existing sessions, the day calendar displays it according to established overlap rules; no duplicate or ghost tiles are shown. [Assumes existing overlap visualization rules]
- Duplicate submissions: If the user double-submits, only one session appears; the UI prevents or deduplicates duplicates.
- Time zones: The day calendar uses Asia/Tokyo for display; sessions appear at the correct Japan local time. Data storage conventions remain as-is.
- Background tabs: If the same user has the calendar open in other tab(s) for the affected date, those tabs automatically show the new session within 1 second without a full reload; other users' views are not auto-updated.
- Filters and search: Active filters (e.g., room, teacher, class, status) remain applied; the new session only appears if it matches.
- Scroll/zoom state: The calendar retains current scroll/zoom position and does not auto-scroll after creation.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The day calendar MUST display a newly created regular class session within 1 second of successful creation, without requiring a manual page refresh or full page reload.
- **FR-002**: The session MUST appear in the correct date/time slot, reflecting the saved details (date, start/end time, teacher, room, class series, status).
- **FR-003**: The calendar MUST respect active filters; if the new session does not match, it MUST not appear. The system MUST show a generic success toast upon creation; it MUST NOT auto-adjust filters or display filter-specific messaging.
- **FR-004**: The calendar view state (current date, scroll position, zoom, selection) MUST be preserved during/after the creation flow and MUST NOT auto-scroll upon creation.
- **FR-005**: The UI MUST avoid duplicate/ghost tiles; a session appears exactly once after creation.
- **FR-006**: If creation fails, the calendar MUST not show the session and MUST present a clear error message; any temporary indicators MUST be removed.
- **FR-007**: If the session is created for a different date than currently displayed, the current view MUST remain unchanged; the session MUST be visible when navigating to its date.
- **FR-008**: Any secondary summaries linked to the day calendar (e.g., counts, side lists) MUST reflect the new session immediately and consistently with filters. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which summaries are in scope?]
- **FR-009**: The behavior MUST be consistent whether the session is created from the day calendar flow or initiated from a class series popup (modal/drawer) on the same page.
- **FR-010**: The feature MUST not degrade perceived performance; the visible update should occur within 1 second on a typical connection and device. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Target performance baseline]
- **FR-011**: After a session is created, all open day calendar views in other tabs for the same authenticated user MUST reflect the new session within 1 second without a full page reload; cross-user propagation is out of scope.
- **FR-012**: The day calendar MUST use Asia/Tokyo as the fixed display time zone for session placement and display, matching existing project conventions.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Class Session**: A scheduled occurrence of a class with attributes such as id, class series reference, date, start time, end time, teacher, room, status.
- **Day Calendar View**: The calendar state for a specific date, including visible time range and UI state (scroll/zoom) and active filters (teacher, room, class series, status).
- **Class Series**: A series/template that can generate sessions across multiple dates; creation from this context can add new sessions on specific dates.
