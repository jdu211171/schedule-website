# Research / Notes

- No existing username/password generators found in repo.
- Schemas only enforce min length for username and password; no pattern conflicts.
- Updated password generator to exclude symbols (letters+digits only), as symbols are not required by API/DB.
- Default length reduced to 6 (schema minimum) to keep autogenerated passwords as short as allowed.
- `RotateCcw` icon already imported in both dialogs; reused for button.
- UI uses Japanese labels; button text set to `自動生成` for consistency.
