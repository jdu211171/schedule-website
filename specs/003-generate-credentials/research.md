# Research / Notes

- No existing username/password generators found in repo.
- Schemas only enforce min length for username and password; no pattern conflicts.
- Updated password generator to exclude symbols (letters+digits only), as symbols are not required by API/DB.
- Default length reduced to 6 (schema minimum) to keep autogenerated passwords as short as allowed.
- `RotateCcw` icon already imported in both dialogs; reused for button.
- UI uses Japanese labels; button text set to `自動生成` for consistency.
-- Added `ID=PW` button to generate username and password with the same value from the username generator.
- Added password eye toggle using `lucide-react` `Eye`/`EyeOff`; placed as an absolute positioned ghost icon inside the input to avoid layout shift.
- Chose username generator output for `ID=PW` to ensure username constraints are always satisfied (>=3, safe chars); password schema allows >=6 so length is 6.
