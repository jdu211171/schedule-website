# Research — Normalize Class Session Statuses

Context

- Issue: Some sessions appeared conflicting in Day Calendar but not counted in Series. Prior batches left blank `status` on overlapping sessions.
- Source of truth: `docs/normalize-class-session-status.md`.

Production Connection

- `PGHOST=aws-0-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com`
- `PGPORT=5432`
- `PGDATABASE=postgres`
- `PGUSER=postgres.icrttrjpxuabpyfmoxve`
- `PGSSLMODE=require`
- `PGPASSWORD` provided out‑of‑band.

Execution Summary (UTC)

- Connectivity: `SELECT 1` OK.
- Dry‑run counts prior to apply:
  - `total_conflicting_now`: 1123
  - `currently_marked_conflicted`: 1
  - `blanks_active`: 3789
- Apply (single transaction):
  - `UPDATE ... CONFLICTED`: 1122 rows affected
  - `UPDATE ... CONFIRMED`: 2746 rows affected
- Post‑apply verification:
  - `status='CONFLICTED'` count: 1123
  - `(status IS NULL OR status='') AND is_cancelled=false` count: 0

Notes & Rationale

- The first update sets `CONFLICTED` for all overlapping active sessions regardless of prior status (except those already `CONFLICTED`). The delta (1122 vs 1123) matches the 1 already marked.
- The second update sets remaining active blanks to `CONFIRMED`, excluding any in the conflicts CTE. This cleared active blanks to 0.
- No deletes or schema changes were performed. Operation is idempotent per runbook.

Follow‑ups

- UI should now reflect aligned conflict counts in the Series view. Ask users to refresh.
- If needed, re‑run with scoped date/branch conditions per runbook.
