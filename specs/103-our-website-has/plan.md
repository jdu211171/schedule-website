# Implementation Plan: Responsive Layout and Zoom Fixes

**Branch**: `103-our-website-has` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/103-our-website-has/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The feature addresses responsive layout issues on small and large screens, and problems with browser zoom. The technical approach involves using `shadcn/ui` and `Tailwind CSS` best practices to create a fully responsive design.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript, Node.js/Bun
**Primary Dependencies**: next, react, tailwindcss, prisma, next-auth, shadcn/ui, zod, tanstack/query
**Storage**: PostgreSQL
**Testing**: vitest, testing-library
**Target Platform**: Web browser
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

No violations of the constitution were found.

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
The research has been completed and the findings are consolidated in `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
The design and contracts have been created. The `data-model.md` and `quickstart.md` files have been generated, and the `contracts` directory has been created.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
The /tasks command will be used to generate the `tasks.md` file. The tasks will be generated based on the `quickstart.md` file and the research findings.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command.

## Complexity Tracking
No complexity deviations were identified.

## Progress Tracking
**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
