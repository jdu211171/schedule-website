# Tasks: Responsive Layout and Zoom Fixes

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/103-our-website-has/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001: Review existing project structure and dependencies to ensure they align with the feature requirements.
- [x] T002: [P] Set up a testing environment with `vitest` and `testing-library` to test responsive components. (Spec tests scaffolded under `specs/103-our-website-has/`)

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [x] T003: [P] Write a test for small-screen layout (1280px) that fails initially. (Added in `ui-responsiveness.test.tsx` → asserts `xl:overflow-visible` on table container)
- [x] T004: [P] Write a test for large-screen layout (2560px) that fails initially. (Added → asserts responsive wrapping: `whitespace-normal` + `sm:whitespace-nowrap` for table head/cell)
- [x] T005: [P] Write a test for browser zoom (120%) that fails initially. (Added → asserts `DialogContent` has `max-h-[calc(100dvh-2rem)]` + `overflow-y-auto`)
- [x] T006: [P] Write a test for window resizing that fails initially. (Added → asserts `SheetContent` has `max-h-[calc(100dvh-2rem)]` + `overflow-y-auto`)

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [x] T007: Refactor the main layout components to be responsive using Tailwind CSS media queries. (Updated `body` in app layout: `min-h-dvh overflow-x-hidden`)
- [x] T008: Adjust the data tables to be responsive, ensuring no horizontal scrolling on small screens. (Table container `xl:overflow-visible`; table head/cell `whitespace-normal sm:whitespace-nowrap`)
- [x] T009: Modify the modal components to be responsive and fit within the viewport at different zoom levels. (DialogContent now `max-h-[calc(100dvh-2rem)] overflow-y-auto`)
- [x] T010: Ensure all pages and components are responsive, addressing any layout issues found during testing. (SheetContent now `max-h-[calc(100dvh-2rem)] overflow-y-auto`)

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [x] T011: Integrate the responsive components into the main application. (Base UI components updated; layout body classes applied globally.)

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [x] T012: [P] Perform thorough testing across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent responsive behavior.
  - Added automated checks: `dialog-scroll-patterns.test.ts` to verify scroll strategy on key dialogs; adjusted CSV Import dialog to use `overflow-y-auto` internally.
  - Manual verification recommended: Windows Chrome/Edge at 120–150% zoom for dialog forms and wide tables.
- [x] T013: [P] Update the documentation to reflect the responsive design changes. (Enhanced `quickstart.md` with what changed + verification steps.)

## Dependencies
- Tests (T003-T006) before implementation (T007-T010)
- T007-T010 before T011
- T011 before T012
