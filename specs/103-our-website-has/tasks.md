# Tasks: Responsive Layout and Zoom Fixes

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/103-our-website-has/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001: Review existing project structure and dependencies to ensure they align with the feature requirements.
- [ ] T002: [P] Set up a testing environment with `vitest` and `testing-library` to test responsive components.

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T003: [P] Write a test for small-screen layout (1280px) that fails initially.
- [ ] T004: [P] Write a test for large-screen layout (2560px) that fails initially.
- [ ] T005: [P] Write a test for browser zoom (120%) that fails initially.
- [ ] T006: [P] Write a test for window resizing that fails initially.

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T007: Refactor the main layout components to be responsive using Tailwind CSS media queries.
- [ ] T008: Adjust the data tables to be responsive, ensuring no horizontal scrolling on small screens.
- [ ] T009: Modify the modal components to be responsive and fit within the viewport at different zoom levels.
- [ ] T010: Ensure all pages and components are responsive, addressing any layout issues found during testing.

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T011: Integrate the responsive components into the main application.

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T012: [P] Perform thorough testing across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent responsive behavior.
- [ ] T013: [P] Update the documentation to reflect the responsive design changes.

## Dependencies
- Tests (T003-T006) before implementation (T007-T010)
- T007-T010 before T011
- T011 before T012

## Parallel Example
