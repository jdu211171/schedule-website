# Quickstart for Responsive Layout and Zoom Fixes

This document provides instructions for testing the responsive layout and zoom fixes.

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Small-Screen Laptop
- **Action**: Open the application in a browser with a viewport width of 1280px.
- **Expected Result**: The layout should adjust to the screen size without any horizontal scrolling.

### 2. Large-Screen Monitor
- **Action**: Open the application in a browser with a viewport width of 2560px.
- **Expected Result**: The content should utilize the available space and not be confined to a narrow column.

### 3. Browser Zoom
- **Action**: Set the browser zoom to 120% and open a data table or modal.
- **Expected Result**: The content should be fully visible and usable without being cut off.

### 4. Window Resizing
- **Action**: Resize the browser window from a wide to a narrow width.
- **Expected Result**: The layout components should reflow dynamically and gracefully.
