# Feature Specification: Responsive Layout and Zoom Fixes

**Feature Branch**: `103-our-website-has`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Our website has layout issues on small-screen laptops and fixed-width problems on larger screens. Additionally, on Windows devices where users increase zoom from 100% to 120% or other values, tables and modals no longer fit properly. Using the latest documentation from shadcn and other reliable sources, can we fix these issues so the site becomes fully responsive for both small and large-screen laptops?"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user on any device, I want the website to display correctly without horizontal scrolling or broken layouts, whether I'm on a small laptop, a large monitor, or using browser zoom, so I can access all information and features comfortably.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on a small-screen laptop (e.g., 13-inch, 1280px width), **When** they view any page, **Then** the layout adjusts to fit the screen without requiring horizontal scrolling.
2. **Given** a user is on a large-screen monitor (e.g., 27-inch, 2560px width), **When** they view any page, **Then** the content utilizes the space effectively and does not remain in a narrow, fixed-width column.
3. **Given** a user on a Windows device has their browser zoom set to 120%, **When** they open a data table or a modal dialog, **Then** the content fits within the viewport and remains fully usable without being cut off.
4. **Given** a user resizes their browser window from a wide to a narrow width, **When** the page is visible, **Then** the layout components (e.g., navigation, tables, forms) reflow dynamically and gracefully.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when browser zoom is set to an extreme value (e.g., 200%)?
- How do very long, non-breaking strings in tables or other content areas behave on small screens?
- Are there specific pages or components that are known to be more problematic than others? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there priority pages/components to fix first?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST render all pages without horizontal scrollbars on viewport widths of 1280px and above.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST ensure all UI components, including tables and modals, are fully visible and functional at a browser zoom level of up to 150%.
- **FR-003**: The main content area MUST expand to fill available horizontal space on large screens, preventing large empty margins.
- **FR-004**: The layout MUST adapt fluidly to different screen sizes, ensuring no elements overlap or become misaligned.
- **FR-005**: The application MUST be responsive across common laptop screen resolutions. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific minimum and maximum target resolutions to support?]
