## Clarifications from Feature Specification

### New Column Placement

- ,**Decision**: Yes, drag-and-drop will be the primary mechanism.
- **Rationale**: It is the most intuitive and common UX pattern for this type of interaction.

## Clarifications from Technical Context

### Performance Goals
