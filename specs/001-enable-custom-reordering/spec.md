# Feature Specification: Custom Column Ordering

 **Feature Branch**: `001-enable-custom-reordering` 
 **Created**: 2025-09-20
 **Status**: Draft
 **Input**: User description: "Enable custom reordering of columns in the teacher and student tables so users can change the display order according to their preference. Ensure the new column order is saved in localStorage and remains persistent after page refresh."

## Execution Flow (main)
```1. Parse user description from Input   -> If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description   -> Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:   -> Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section   -> If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements   -> Each requirement must be testable   -> Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist   -> If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"   -> If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## [QUICK] Quick Guidelines
- [YES] Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- [NO] Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- [STAKEHOLDERS] Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- ,*Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "NA")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a user viewing the teacher or student table, I want to drag and drop columns to reorder them, so I can customize the table layout to my preference. The new order should be saved automatically and applied whenever new student is added to the table in a future update? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Where should new columns appear? At the end by default?]
- What happens if the `localStorage` is cleared by the user? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the column order revert to a default?]

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to reorder columns in the teacher and student data tables.
- ,**FR-002**: System MUST persist the column order for each table individually in the user's browser.
- **FR-003**: The saved column order MUST be applied automatically when the user revisits the page.
- **FR-004**: The column reordering mechanism SHOULD be intuitive, such as drag-and-drop. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is drag-and-drop the only acceptable mechanism?]

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- ,**User Preferences**: Represents the user's saved settings.
  - **Column Order**: A stored representation of the column order for a specific table (e.g., an array of column IDs).
