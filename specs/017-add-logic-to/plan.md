# Implementation Plan: User-Configurable Class Type Visibility

**Branch**: `017-add-logic-to` | **Date**: 2025-10-11 | **Spec**: /home/user/Development/schedule-website/specs/017-add-logic-to/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/017-add-logic-to/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Provide per-user control to hide unnecessary Class Types so the Day Calendar and class type filter controls only show relevant options. Preferences persist per user across sessions/devices. Hidden types are excluded from calendar rendering and from filter option lists. Include a temporary “Show all” override and a “Reset to default” action.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (strict)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js App Router, React, Zod, Prisma (existing), Tailwind CSS  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (persist per-user class type visibility preferences)  
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Web (admin/staff/teacher/student schedule views)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + API routes within Next.js)  
**Performance Goals**: UI reflects visibility changes within ~1s for ≤100 Class Types  
**Constraints**: Do not degrade schedule render responsiveness; accessible controls; no invisible-but-active filters  
**Scale/Scope**: Up to 100 Class Types; thousands of sessions per day across views

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Source: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` contains only placeholders (no concrete rules). Therefore, no explicit constitutional constraints are currently enforceable.

Derived gates (from repository guidelines):
- Use Spec Kit for planning and tracking; keep `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and create `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`.
- Use Bun for packages; fix TypeScript errors after changes (tracked for implementation phase).
- Prefer local PostgreSQL via psql for ops (tracked for ops validation phase).

Pre-design status: PASS (no violations).
Post-design status: PASS (see re-check below).

```

**Structure Decision**: Web application within Next.js App Router using existing folders. Add minimal API endpoints and client hooks for per-user class type visibility. Source roots: `src/app`, `src/components`, `src/lib`, `src/hooks`, `src/services`, `src/schemas`, `src/types`, `prisma/`, `scripts/`.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
