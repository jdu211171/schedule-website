# Feature Specification: Conflicting Class Session Resolution

**Feature Branch**: `009-we-should-show`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We should show the conflicting class session in the day-calendar to be resolved in the シリーズの授業一覧 modal when edit is clicked for conflicted class sessions instead of 授業の編集 modal, and after users resolve that conflict they can close. What do you think, can we optimally achieve that?"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: When a user closes the conflict resolution modal without saving their changes, how should the system respond? → A: Show a warning prompt asking the user to confirm if they want to discard unsaved changes.
- Q: How should the UI present conflicts involving more than two class sessions in the series modal? → A: Open that day's day calendar.
- Q: Within the "シリーズの授業一覧" (Class Series List) modal, what is the most critical component for resolving a conflict? → A: The ability to directly edit the date/time of each session in a list.
- Q: How is a 'conflict' technically defined? → A: Overlapping time for same teacher, student, or booth.
- Q: Which view should be used for conflict resolution? → A: Use the day calendar view.

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user, when I click to edit a conflicting class session in the day-calendar, I want to be taken to the day calendar view for that day, so that I can see the conflict in context and resolve it.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a class session with a conflict is displayed on the day-calendar, **When** the user clicks the "edit" button for that session, **Then** the user should be navigated to the day calendar view for the date of the conflicting session.
2. **Given** a class session with no conflict is displayed on the day-calendar, **When** the user clicks the "edit" button for that session, **Then** the standard "授業の編集" (Edit Class) modal should be displayed.

### Edge Cases

- If the user attempts to close the modal without resolving the conflict, the system MUST show a warning prompt to confirm discarding changes.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST detect a scheduling conflict when two sessions on the same date have overlapping times and share the same teacher, student, or booth.
- **FR-002**: When a user initiates an edit on a conflicted class session from the day-calendar, the system MUST navigate to the day calendar view for the date of the conflicting session.
- **FR-003**: When a user initiates an edit on a non-conflicted class session from the day-calendar, the system MUST display the "授業の編集" (Edit Class) modal.
- **FR-004**: The day calendar view MUST provide the necessary information and controls to resolve the scheduling conflict.
- **FR-005**: After a conflict is resolved, the day-calendar view MUST update to reflect the changes.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Class Session**: Represents a single class instance. It has attributes like date, time, teacher, student, and status (e.g., Conflicted).
- **Class Series**: A collection of related Class Sessions.
