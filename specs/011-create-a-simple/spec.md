# Feature Specification: Password Change UI

**Feature Branch**: `011-create-a-simple`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a simple UI that allows admins, staff, teachers, and students to change their passwords, since currently no such UI exists. Use shadcn components for the implementation and follow existing code patterns for consistency. Decide the most appropriate place in the application to add this UI. Ensure that teacher and student passwords are treated as plain text, while maintaining the expected behavior for admin and staff password handling."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03

- Q: What are the existing security measures for Admin and Staff passwords? ‚Üí A: Hashing with a salt
- Q: Where is the most appropriate place to add the password change UI? ‚Üí A: Add a "Change Password" link to the user menu dropdown (e.g., where "Logout" is).
- Q: What password complexity requirements, if any, should be enforced for each role? ‚Üí A: Minimum 4 characters for all roles.
- Q: How should the system handle a user trying to change their password to their old password? ‚Üí A: Allow it. The user can reuse their old password.

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user (Admin, Staff, Teacher, or Student), I want to be able to change my password within the application so that I can manage my own account security.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an Admin is logged in, **When** they navigate to the password change UI and submit a new password, **Then** their password is changed.
2. **Given** a Staff member is logged in, **When** they navigate to the password change UI and submit a new password, **Then** their password is changed.
3. **Given** a Teacher is logged in, **When** they navigate to the password change UI and submit a new password, **Then** their password is changed.
4. **Given** a Student is logged in, **When** they navigate to the password change UI and submit a new password, **Then** their password is changed.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user enters a new password that does not meet the complexity requirements?
- What happens if a user's session expires while they are on the change password page?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a user interface for users to change their password.
- **FR-002**: The password change UI MUST be accessible to Admin, Staff, Teacher, and Student roles.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST treat passwords for Teacher and Student roles as plain text.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST handle Admin and Staff passwords by hashing them with a salt.
- **FR-005**: The password change UI MUST be accessible via a "Change Password" link in the user menu dropdown.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST enforce a minimum password length of 4 characters for all roles.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST allow a user to change their password to their previous password.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **User**: Represents an individual with access to the system. Key attributes: `role` (Admin, Staff, Teacher, Student), `password`.
