# Cancelled Lesson Text Color

## Problem
- Cancelled class sessions are greyed (grayscale) but text remains white in light mode, reducing readability.

## Goal
- For cancelled lessons, force text color to black in light mode and white in dark mode.

## Acceptance Criteria
- In light theme, cancelled lesson cards display black text.
- In dark theme, cancelled lesson cards display white text.
- No changes to non-cancelled lessons.
